<h1>Object Oriented Recursion Tree</h1>
<p>This project was made using <a href = "https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> and was inspired by <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcdNSZ9IzJM">this Coding Train video</a>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Object Oriented</strong> approach was used due to the possibility of manipulating the tree, wich wouldn't be possible <em>or at least harder</em> in a convencional
approach</p>
